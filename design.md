Design Philosophy

I design interfaces as editorial spaces, not products.

My work is rooted in print logic: clear hierarchy, visible structure, generous margins, and typography as the primary interface. Layouts should feel like pages you read, not screens you operate.

I favor quiet brutalism—strong grids, honest alignment, and minimal decoration—softened by human imperfection. Hand-drawn marks, subtle highlights, uneven lines, and visible process introduce warmth and personality without noise.

I avoid visual performance. No excessive motion, no ornamental UI, no novelty for its own sake. Interaction should feel calm, restrained, and intentional. When motion exists, it supports presence, not attention.

I value suggestion over instruction. Annotations, lines, and accents exist to guide the eye subtly, never to explain aggressively. The design should trust the reader.

The goal is not to impress quickly, but to hold attention quietly—to feel thoughtful, personal, and slightly unfinished in a way that invites curiosity.

Design, to me, is a balance between structure and softness, discipline and intimacy, system and handwriting.

AI Inspiration Context (Copy-Paste Ready)

Use this as context for any AI design generation, critique, or continuation:

The design aesthetic is editorial and print-inspired. Interfaces should feel like quiet magazine pages, research archives, or personal notebooks rather than modern SaaS products.

Favor strong grid systems, visible margins, and clear typographic hierarchy. Typography is the primary interface element. Layouts should breathe and avoid visual clutter.

Brutalist structure is welcome, but it must be softened with human elements: hand-drawn lines, imperfect strokes, subtle highlights, and visible process. Designs should feel warm, thoughtful, and slightly imperfect—not polished or performative.

Use muted, off-white backgrounds, black or near-black text, and very limited accent colors (e.g., soft pinks or marker-like yellows) used sparingly.

Motion should be minimal and calm: fades over slides, no bouncy easing, no path-drawing effects. Silence and restraint are preferred.

Avoid trendy UI patterns, heavy animations, gradients, or decorative effects. The design should suggest rather than explain, guide rather than instruct.

Overall tone: quiet, cozy, editorial, human, intelligent, and restrained.
